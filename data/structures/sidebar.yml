  Renders the sidebar navigation of a single page. It is intended to be used as
  companion to the main navigation and is typically used in content-heavy
  sections, such as documentation pages. On smaller screens, the sidebar is
  replaced with an offcanvas element. In this case, the main navigation receives
  an additional toggler on the left of the screen.
