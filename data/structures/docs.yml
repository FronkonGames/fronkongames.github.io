    Capture a code snippet from a `toml` or `scss` input file. The shortcode scans for named markers in a local file:   
    - For `.toml` files, use `# toml-docs-start` and `# toml-docs-end` followed by the snippet name
    - For `.scss` files, use `// scss-docs-start` and `// scss-docs-end` followed by the snippet name
    
    The snippet between the two markers is then rendered using syntax highlighting.

      Path of the input file. The path is relative to the `basePath` defined in
      the `docs` section of the site's parameters. If the file starts with `./`,
      the path of the repository is used as base path instead.

      If unset, shows the panel with the code snippet in collapsed state. By

      ID of the collapse panel holding the code snippet, defaults to
