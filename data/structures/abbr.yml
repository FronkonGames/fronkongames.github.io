  Creates an HTML element that shows the long form of an abbrevitation. The
  abbreviation data is centrally stored in a data file. By default, the
  shortcode uses `abbr.yaml` with translation support.
  
  The data file is expected to store key-value pairs, where `id` is the
  lower-case abbrevation and `long` its long form. The following example
  illustrates this using YML:

  - id: css
    long: `Cascading Style Sheets`
arguments:
  key:
    type: string
    position: 0
    optional: false

      Case-insensitive key of the abbreviation. In shorthand notation, this is
      the first (and only) matched argument. Non-alphanumeric keys must be quoted.
  data:
    type: string
    default: abbr.yaml
    optional: true

      Filename of the abbrevation input. You can omit the file extension. The
      file should reside in the `data` folder. The data supports language
      extensions. For example, `abbr.en.yaml` refers to the English translation
      of the abbrevation data. The filename `abbr.yaml` is used when no suitable
      translation is found.
  class:
    type: string
    optional: true

      Class attribute of the abbr element. For example, specify `initialism` for
      a slightly smaller font size.
