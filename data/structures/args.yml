  expected to be defined in a data file identified by a provided structure name.
arguments:
  structure:
    type: string
    position: 0
    optional: false
    comment: >-
      Name of the data file that contains argument definitions. Supported data
      formats include JSON, TOML, YAML, and XML. You can omit the file
      extension. The file should reside in the `data/structures` folder.
  group:
    type: string
    position: 1
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Name of the group filter. This is typically used when a shortcode and
      partial have common arguments. The group filter binds a specific argument
      to a particular group. By default, an argument belongs to all groups.
  parent:
    type: bool
    position: 2
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Flag to filter only arguments that have a parent attribute (either
      `cascade` or `merge`).
