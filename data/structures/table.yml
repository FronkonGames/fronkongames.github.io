      By default, the table shortcode is responsive for all viewports. When a
      breakpoint is set, the table will behave normally and not scroll
      horizontally from the provided breakpoint and up. Use `none` to disable
      this behavior. You can specify multiple breakpoints when using positional
      arguments.
