      Loading behavior of the image. The loading of lazily loaded images is
      deferred until the image is within scrolling range of the viewport. This
      should reduce the initial loading time of the website. It is recommended
      to lazily load only those images that are below the pagefold.

        - lazy

    type: bool
    optional: true

      Sets the current carousel item as active (only one item at a time). By
