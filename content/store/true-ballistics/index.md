#### What Can Be Used For

✅ **Realistic Ballistics Simulation**: Accurate trajectories with proper physics for FPS, military, hunting, ...
✅ **Material Penetration**: Realistic projectile behavior through different materials (wood, metal, concrete, etc).
✅ **Ricochet Effects**: Physically-based bullet deflection off surfaces .
✅ **Long-Range Shooting**: Precision ballistics for sniper games with environmental factors.
✅ **Performance-Critical Games**: Optimized for handling thousands of simultaneous projectiles.

#### What Is NOT

❌ **FPS Controller**: While it includes a `SimpleFPS` system, it's designed for ballistics simulation, **not as a FPS character controller**.
❌ **Visual Effects System**: Focuses on physics simulation rather than muzzle flashes, explosions, or other visual effects.
❌ **Weapon Animation System**: Doesn't handle weapon animations, reloading animations, or complex weapon mechanics.
❌ **Audio System**: Doesn't provide comprehensive audio management beyond basic demo sounds.
❌ **Networking Solution**: Designed for single-player simulations, not multiplayer networking.
❌ **Energy Weapons or Propelled Projectiles**: Designed for ballistic projectiles only, doesn't support laser weapons, plasma guns, or self-propelled projectiles like rockets and missiles.

## Installation

Requirements:

* Unity 6000.0 LTS or newer.

Installation:

1. Download and import the `True Ballistics` asset from the Unity Asset Store into your Unity project.
3. No additional setup is required. The asset is ready to use out of the box!

## How to Use

The `BallisticsManager` component is the central hub of the ballistics system. It manages the lightweight ECS, handles projectile spawning, and coordinates all ballistic systems.

Create an empty GameObject and add the `BallisticsManager` component (Fronkon Games → True Ballistics → Ballistics Manager)

{{< image src="inspector_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

### Add systems

Systems are modules that take care of a task. You can add as many as you want in `Systems`, this way you will only use the ones you need.

They are [ScriptableObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) and therefore files. You can create them from the `Project` window (Fronkon Games → True Ballistics → Systems)

{{< image src="inspector_1.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

All the systems included are discussed in more detail below. The minimum recommended systems are:

- **Physics System**: without this system the projectiles would not move.
- **Lifecycle System**: is in charge of _recycling_ projectiles. Without this system the projectiles would never be destroyed and when reaching the maximum number (5000 by default), no new ones would be created.
- **Collision System**: the one in charge of reporting collisions with projectiles.

Once these three systems are added, you can fire a projectile in this way:

```csharp
// Get the manager instance
BallisticsManager manager = FindFirstObjectByType<BallisticsManager>();

// Spawn a projectile
int projectileEntity = manager.SpawnProjectile(
    weaponData,          // WeaponData ScriptableObject
    transform.position,  // Spawn position
    transform.rotation,  // Spawn rotation
    1.0f,                // Dispersion multiplier
    true,                // Can jam
    1.0f                 // Velocity multiplier
);

// Spawn pellets (for shotguns)
List<int> pellets = manager.SpawnPellets(
    weaponData,          // WeaponData ScriptableObject
    shellData,           // ShellData ScriptableObject
    transform.position,  // Spawn position
    transform.rotation   // Spawn rotation
);
```

`weaponData` is another ScriptableObject (a file) with all the relevant data of a weapon model. You have more than 380 in the `FronkonGames/TrueBallistics/Data/Weapons` folder.

{{< image src="inspector_2.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

In the case of shotguns, in addition to the corresponding `weaponData`, you must add `shellData`, the type of cartridge you want to use. You can find several in `FronkonGames/TrueBallistics/Data/Ammo`.

You can create new weapons (and shells) from the `Project` window (Fronkon Games → True Ballistics → Weapon Data / Fronkon Games → True Ballistics → Shell Data).

{{< image src="inspector_3.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

This is an example of the weapons included:

* **Components**: Data structures (PhysicsComponent, DragComponent, etc).
* **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on entities with specific components.

### Physics System

{{< image src="inspector_4.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

Handles core ballistics physics including gravity, drag, and atmospheric effects. Without this system the projectiles **would not move**.

**Features**:
- Configurable gravity vector (supports other planets).
- Air density simulation with altitude effects.
- Multiple drag models (G1, G2, G5, G6, G7, G8).
- Wind effects and atmospheric conditions.
- Burst-compiled jobs for performance.

**Configuration**:
- `Gravity`: Gravity vector (default: Earth's 9.81 m/s²).
  - Moon: 1.62 m/s².
  - Mars: 3.71 m/s².
  - Jupiter: 24.79 m/s².

  - 145 m/s at 50,000 meters.
- `Max Speed`: Maximum projectile velocity in m/s (default value is 299,792,458 m/s, the speed of light in vacuum).

If you add `Debug System` to the system list, you will be able to see the trajectories of the projectiles in the `Scene` window.

{{< image src="physics_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

The trajectory of the projectile will have these colors:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<center>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

| Color &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Initial Velocity |
|----------|-------------------:|
| Red | >=75% |
| Orange | >=50% |
| Yellow | >=25% |
| Green | >=10% |
| Gray | <10% |

{{< rawhtml >}}
</center>
<br>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

{{< alert color="light" >}}
**In general**, impacts in Green or Gray are not lethal.
{{< /alert >}}

### Lifecycle System

{{< image src="inspector_5.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

Manages projectile lifecycle with configurable termination rules. **It is essential to add this system**, since it is in charge of _recycling_ projectiles. Without this system, when the maximum number of projectiles is reached (5000 by default), no more can be created.

If any of the following (active) rules are met, the projectile is deactivated.

#### Max Lifetime Rule

Deactivates the projectile if its lifetime has exceeded a certain limit.

#### Min Speed Percentage Rule

Deactivates the projectile if its speed is below a certain percentage.

#### Min Bounds Rule

Deactivates the projectile if its coordinates are less than a certain limit.

#### Max Bounds Rule

Deactivates the projectile if its coordinates are greater than a certain limit.

#### Stationary Rule

Deactivates the projectile if it has been stationary for a certain amount of time.

#### Max Distance Rule

Deactivates the projectile if it has traveled a certain linear distance from its point of origin.

#### One Collision Rule

Deactivates the projectile after its first collision.

If you use the `Ricochet System`, a bouncing projectile **does not count for this rule**.

#### Ricochet Rule

Deactivates the projectile if a ricochet occurred with an angle lower than a certain limit.

#### Ricochet Failed Rule

If true, projectiles are deactivated upon any impact that does not result in a ricochet. This overrides `One Collision Rule` if both are true.

### Collision System

{{< image src="inspector_6.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

Efficient collision detection with adaptive algorithms. Remember that for a projectile to collide with an object on the stage, this object must have some kind of [Collider](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/collision-section.html).

**Features**:
- Raycast for high-speed projectiles.
- Batched SphereCasts for regular projectiles.
- Configurable layer masks.
- Automatic material detection.

**Configuration**:
- `Layer Mask`: Collision layers.
- `High Speed Threshold`: Percentage of the speed of light (default 10%) at which RayCast is used instead of SphereCast (the projectile is considered instantaneous).

Once added to the systems, you can subscribe to the `OnProjectileHit` events to receive information on each impact.

```csharp
// Cache all colliders on this object and its children for efficient hit detection
colliders = this.GetComponentsInChildren<Collider>();

// Get the manager instance
BallisticsManager manager = FindFirstObjectByType<BallisticsManager>();

// Subscribe to projectile hit event (don't forget to unsubscribe)
ballisticsManager.OnProjectileHit += OnProjectileHitHandler;

...

private void OnProjectileHitHandler(CollisionInfo info)
{
  // Skip processing if collision info is invalid
  if (info.collider == null)
    return;

  // Check if the hit collider belongs to this object (or any of its children)
  foreach (Collider c in colliders)
  {
    if (c != null && info.collider == c)
    {
      // Doing something
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

Check these classes in `FronkonGames/TrueBallistics/Demos/Scripts` for more examples:
* **Coin**: A coin that oscillates and disappears upon impact.
* **DestroyOnHit**: The object is destroyed on impact.
* **NonKinematicOnHit**: Changes a Kinematic object to Non Kinematic on impact.

If you add `Debug System` to the system list, you will be able to see the impacts of the projectiles (a circle with a diagonal cross) in the `Scene` window.

{{< image src="collision_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

{{< alert color="light" >}}
Objects with Colliders and physics ([RigidBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/rigidbody-physics-section.html)) **do not receive any physical impulse** when hitting a projectile (it is not the goal of this library). However you can consult the `RigidBodyManager` class to see an example of how to do it.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="light" >}}
Neither create bullet marks or particles at the point of impact, although you can see how this is done in the demo in the `HolesManager` and `SparksManager` classes. Both solutions are quite rudimentary (enough for the purposes of the demo) so **I do not recommend** using them in production environments.
{{< /alert >}}

### Ricochet System

{{< image src="inspector_7.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

Realistic ricochet simulation based on impact angle and material properties.

**Features**:
- Probability-based ricochet calculation.
- Physically-based velocity changes.
- Material-specific restitution.
- Energy retention modeling.

Once added to the systems, you can subscribe to the `OnProjectileRicochet` events to receive information on each ricochet. If you use `Collision System`, an `OnProjectileHit` event will also be emitted.

If you add `Debug System` to the system list, you will be able to see the ricochets (a square with an arrow indicating rebound) in the `Scene` window.

{{< image src="ricochet_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}


### Penetration System

{{< image src="inspector_8.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

Advanced penetration mechanics with energy-based calculations and materials. 

**Features**:
- Entry/exit point calculation.
- Energy consumption modeling.
- Path deflection on entry.
- Stuck projectile handling.

**Configuration**:
- `Layer Mask`: Layers considered for penetration raycasts.
- `Energy Scale`: Scaling factor applied to material strength when computing required energy. Lower than 1.0 will make the projectile more likely to penetrate.
- `Max Entry Deflection Angle`: Maximum angle in degrees by which a projectile's path can be deflected upon entering a surface, based on incidence angle.

This system (and actually Collision and Ricochet) uses `Ballistic Material` for its calculations. If you do not assign any material to the objects, it will use `Default Material` from `Ballistic Manager` (see above). If you do not assign any, the 'Concrete' material will be used.

In the `FronkonGames/TrueBallistics/Data/Materials` folder you have a few materials already defined. You can also create your own (they are ScriptableObjects) from the `Project` window and using the menu `Fronkon Games → True Ballistics → Material Data`.

{{< image src="material_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

**Configuration**:
- `Description`: Description of the material.
- `Min Angle For Ricochet Prob`: Angle (degrees) from surface normal. Impacts at angles greater than this (grazing angles) have increasing ricochet probability.
- `Guaranteed Ricochet Angle`: Angle (degrees) from surface normal. Impacts at angles greater than this (very grazing angles) will always ricochet if probability is met.
- `Ricochet Probability Curve`: Curve defining ricochet probability (Y-axis, 0-1) based on impact angle with surface normal (X-axis, 0-90 degrees). Higher angles = more grazing.
- `Restitution Normal`: Coefficient of restitution for the velocity component normal to the surface (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect bounce).
- `Restitution Tangent`: Coefficient of restitution for the velocity component tangential to the surface (0 = sticks, 1 = no friction).
- `Energy Retention Factor`: Overall percentage of kinetic energy retained after ricochet (0 = all lost, 1 = all retained). Applied AFTER restitution effects if both are used conceptually.
- `Density`: Density of the material in kg/m^3. Used for penetration calculations.
- `Yield Strength`: Yield strength of the material in MPa. Higher values resist penetration.

Add the `Ballistic Material` component to the objects you want to specify a material. Remember that they must be at the same level as the collider that detects the impact.

{{< alert color="light" >}}
In `Ballistic Material` you can activate `Use Material Cache` to improve performance, but note that if you do so, you will not be able to change at runtime the material of the objects.
{{< /alert >}}

Three events related to projectile penetration are use:

* **OnProjectilePenetrationEnter**: When a projectile penetration starts (enters an object).
* **OnProjectilePenetrationExit**: When a projectile exits an object after penetration.
* **OnProjectilePenetrationStuck**: When a projectile gets stuck inside an object.

If you add `Debug System` to the system list, you will be able to see the the entry point (a circle with a vertical cross), the trajectory (in cyan color) and the exit point (a circle with a vertical cross).

{{< image src="penetration_0.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

If the projectile gets stuck inside the object, you will see its trajectory (in magenta) and the point where the projectile is (magenta circle with vertical cross).

{{< image src="penetration_1.jpg" wrapper="col-9 mx-auto">}}

{{< alert color="light" >}}
Some considerations:
* Objects with a width of less than 1mm will be ignored.
* On objects 10 meters or more wide, penetration will always fail.

### Customs Systems

Creating a custom system involves inheriting from `SystemBase` and implementing the required methods:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "CustomSystem", menuName = "My Game/Custom System")]
public class CustomSystem : SystemBase
{
  // Execution order (lower = earlier)
  public override int ExecutionOrder => 1500;
    
  // System initialization
  public override void Initialize(BallisticsManager manager)
  {
      base.Initialize(manager);
      // Setup system resources
  }
    
  // Called before physics update
  public override void PreTick(float deltaTime)
  {
      if (!active) return;
      // Pre-physics logic
  }
    
  // Main system update
  public override void Tick(float deltaTime)
  {
      if (!active) return;
      // Main system logic
  }
    
  // Called after physics update
  public override void PostTick(float deltaTime)
  {
      if (!active) return;
      // Post-physics logic
  }
    
  // System cleanup
  public override void DeInitialize()
  {
      // Cleanup resources
      base.DeInitialize();
  }
}
```

**Example: Simple Gravity Well System**

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "GravityWellSystem", menuName = "My Game/Gravity Well System")]
public class GravityWellSystem : SystemBase
{
  [Header("Gravity Well Settings")]
  public Transform gravityWellCenter;
  public float gravityWellStrength = 10f;
  public float gravityWellRadius = 50f;
  public override int ExecutionOrder => SystemExecution.Physics + 50; // After PhysicsSystem
  public override void PostTick(float deltaTime)
  {
    if (!active || gravityWellCenter == null) return;
    
    // Get component arrays
    var physicsComponents = manager.GetComponentArray<PhysicsComponent>();
    
    // Process all entities with physics components
    for (int i = 0; i < BallisticsManager.MaxEntities; i++)
    {
      if (!manager.entities[i]) continue;
      
      ref var physics = ref physicsComponents[i];
      
      // Calculate distance to gravity well
      Vector3 toWell = gravityWellCenter.position - physics.position;
      float distance = toWell.magnitude;
      
      // Apply gravity well force if within radius
      if (distance < gravityWellRadius && distance > 0.1f)
      {
        float force = gravityWellStrength / (distance * distance);
        Vector3 gravityForce = toWell.normalized * force * physics.mass;
          
        // Apply force
        physics.velocity += gravityForce * deltaTime / physics.mass;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
