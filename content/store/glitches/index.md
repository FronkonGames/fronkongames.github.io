{{< alert color="light" >}}
You can obtain each effect separately, but if you want multiple effects, you might be interested in **'[GLITCHES BUNDLE](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-bundle-295977?aid=1101l9zFC&utm_source=aff)'** where you can find them all at a special price!
{{< /alert >}}

## Requirements

All '**Glitches**' effects are developed for '[Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/index.html)' (or URP), which means they will **not work** with Built-In, or HDRP.

#### Unity 6 or higher

All effects are compatible with **Unity 6** using **[Compatibility Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/compatibility-mode.html)**. You can activate it in **Project Settings > Graphics > URP > Render Graph > Compatibility Mode**. I am working on making them compatible with Render Graph.

You will need to have URP version *17.0.2* or higher installed. In the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/InstallURPIntoAProject.html) you can find the steps to install it correctly.

#### Unity 2022.3 or higher

You will need to have URP version *12.1.15* or higher installed. If you don't know how to do it, I recommend you to follow this [official tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html).

## Using them in the Editor

Once installed, you have to add the effect you want to use from '**Glitches**' as a '[Render Feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature.html)'. This [official tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature-how-to-add.html) tells how to do it.

{{< image src="editor_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

Remember that the camera you are using must have the '**Post Processing**' option enabled.

{{< image src="editor_1.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

## VR

To increase compatibility with VR devices, I recommend that you select '**Stereo Rendering Mode**' in '**Multi Pass**' mode:

{{< image src="vr.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

## Using them in code

Once you have added the effect in the Editor, you can also handle '**Glitches**' effects by code. 

First you must add the corresponding namespace. They are all of the style 'FronkonGames.Glitches.XXXX', where XXXX is the name of the effect. For example, if the effect you want to use is '**Color Blindness**' the code would be:

```csharp
using FronkonGames.Glitches.ColorBlindness;
```

To modify any of the effect parameters, you must first request its __settings__. In the following example we change the intensity of the effect by half.

```csharp
ColorBlindness.Settings settings = ColorBlindness.GetSettings();

settings.intensity = 0.5f;
```

If you are using an effect other than '**Color Blindness**' just change it to its name. Check the source code comments for more information.

{{< alert color="warning" icon="fas triangle-exclamation" >}}
Do not use the code of the demos in your projects, they are only there to show you the use of the effect through code.

## Color Blindness {#colorblindness}
{{< asset-header youtube="f5CiPt9bzBE" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-color-blindness-273126" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/colorblindness/">}}

{{< alert color="danger" icon="fas triangle-exclamation" >}}
This asset **simulates** a series of vision defects, **NOT** corrects them.
{{< /alert >}}

'**Color Blindness**' simulates the most common vision defects.

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="colorblindness_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

Select the type of deficiency you want to simulate with '**Deficiency**' (_2_):

* **Protanomaly**: red-green vision deficiency, 1% of males, 0.03% of females.
* **Deuteranomaly**: red-green color blindness, 6% of males, 0.4% of females.
* **Tritanomaly**: blue-yellow color blindness, 0.01% for males and females.
* **Protanopia**: reds are greatly reduced, 1% of males, 0.02% of females.
* **Deuteranopia**: greens are greatly reduced, 1% of males.
* **Tritanopia**: blues are greatly reduced, 0.003% population.
* **Achromatopsia**: total color blindness, 0.001% population.
* **Achromatomaly**: partial color blindness, 0.00001% population.

In order to compare the result with a normal view, move '**Comparator**'.

## Corrupt Memory {#corruptmemory}
{{< asset-header youtube="F4ubH6fGgcA" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-corrupt-memory-274730" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/corruptmemory/">}}

'**Corrupt Memory**' emulates malfunctioning memory.

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="corruptmemory_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

The effect generates a pattern of overlapping rectangles that change dimensions and position randomly. The first parameters (from _2_ to _6_), modify this pattern. If you want to see it better, activate '**Debug view**' (_10_).

The first thing you can adjust is the complexity (_2_) of the pattern and the density (_3_) of the rectangles. Then the speed (_4_) with which they vary and their displacement (_5_) on the screen. Finally you can also change their magnification (_6_).

The pattern is used to define the zones where three effects will be applied. The first one is a pixelation effect (_7_), then a chromatic aberration effect (_8_) and finally an image displacement effect (_9_).

In all of them you can adjust the limit at which it is activated ('_Threshold_'). With a very high limit, it will use very few rectangles of the pattern. With a very low limit, many.

---
## Interferences {#interferences}
{{< asset-header youtube="lYrj9jj3U8Y" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-interferences-281861" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/interferences/">}}

With '**Interferences**' you can simulate video transmission failures.

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="interferences_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

With '**Blend**' (_2_) modify the color operation used to blend the original pixel with the effect pixel.

'**Offset**' (_3_) amplifies the strength of the effect.

From the distortion effect (_4_) you can control different variables such as speed, density, amplitude and frequency.

The second effect applied is scanlines (_5_) and you can adjust its density and opacity.

---
## VHS {#vhs}
{{< asset-header youtube="f3W4_dPwZK0" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-vhs-282181" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/vhs/">}}

Accurately emulates an old VHS tape. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="vhs_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

**VHS**' consists of two very typical effects of the old VHS tapes: the noise and the pause.

The first one can be controlled using '**Noise**' (_2_) and its parameters. The second with '**Pause**' (_3_) and '**Pause Band**' (_4_).

If you want to use only the noise, set '**Pause**' (_3_) and '**Pause Band**' (_4_) to zero. If you only want to use the pause effect, set '**Noise**' (_2_) to zero.

---
## Distortions {#distortions}
{{< asset-header youtube="ydWFcmFnSaU" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-distortions-282947" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/distortions/">}}

## Bap GPU {#bad-gpu}
{{< asset-header youtube="Q86NARQPUJk" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-bad-gpu-288689" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/bad-gpu/">}}

Simulates the effects of a broken GPU, using a combination of four glitch effects. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="badgpu_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

'**Intensity**' (_1_) controls the overall strength of the effect. If set to 0, the effect will be inactive.

'**Balance**' (_2_) adjusts the mix between the original image and the effect. Values below 0 prioritize the original image, while values above 0 enhance the effect.

'**Booster**' (_3_) amplifies both intensity and brightness, making the effect more pronounced.

The '**Blend**' (_4_) option defines the color blending operation used between the effect and the original image.

'**Tint**' (_5_) allows you to apply a color tint to the effect.

For '**Glitch #1**' (_6_), you can adjust the intensity, speed, and threshold to control how the first glitch effect behaves.

Similarly, ''**Glitch #2**'' (_7_), '**Glitch #3**' (_8_), and '**Glitch #4**' (_9_) each have settings for intensity, speed, and threshold, allowing for different glitch effects with individual adjustments.

---
## Artifacts {#artifacts}
{{< asset-header youtube="tyg11e6XrQQ" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-artifacts-288952" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/artifacts/">}}

Simulates the artifacts generated by a bad video reception. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="artifacts_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

The '**Intensity**' (_1_) setting controls how strong the effect appears. If set to 0, the effect will be disabled. The '**Size**' (_2_) parameter adjusts the dimensions of the visual artifacts, altering their width and height.

With '**Aberration**' (_3_), you can modify the color distortion (chromatic aberration) to add or reduce visual shifts in color.

The '**Interleave**' (_4_) option allows you to control how intense the interleaving effect is, which can create a layered or staggered visual appearance.

For the '**Luminance range**' (_5_), this setting defines the brightness levels where the effect is applied. If the scene's luminance is lower than the minimum (luminanceRange.x) or higher than the maximum (luminanceRange.y), the effect won’t activate.

The '**Blocks**' (_6_) setting influences the intensity of the block effect, with higher values adding more interphase blocks. You can also adjust how the color blends and customize the color of the blocks themselves.

Lastly, the '**Lines**' (_7_) option determines the density of the lines in the effect. Increasing this value adds more lines, and you can also tweak how these lines blend with the existing colors in the scene.

---
## Hacked {#hacked}
{{< asset-header youtube="gjgyrVs8yx0" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-hacked-293724" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/hacked/">}}

Visually emulates a hacking using various effects. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="hacked_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

'**Intensity**' (_1_) of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

The hacking effect is achieved by combining six different effects. '**Strength**' (_2_) modulates the intensity of **all** these effects.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_framejump.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Frame jump" >}}

The first effect is '**Frame jump**' (_3_), commonly caused by a synchronization failure between the signal and the monitor. In addition to its intensity, you can adjust its speed.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_jitter.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Jitter" >}}

'**Jitter**' (_4_) creates horizontal bands that _slice_ the image. In addition to their intensity and speed, you can modify their density.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_blocks.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Blocks" >}}

'**Blocks**' (_5_) creates a multitude of blocks that deform the color channels. You can adjust their density, chromatic aberration intensity and noise.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_waves.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Waves" >}}

With '**Waves**' (_6_) you can add a sine wave deformation that alters the color channels, and you can adjust its speed and the intensity of the color channel separation.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_scanlines.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Scanlines" >}}

'**Scanlines**' (_7_) adds a horizontal noise.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_noise.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Noise" >}}

Finally '**Noise**' (_8_) creates the classic analog noise.

---
## Broken LCD {#broken-lcd}
{{< asset-header youtube="BgRcZrxu280" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-broken-lcd-294991" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/broken-lcd/">}}

Emulates a broken LCD screen. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="brokenlcd_0.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

'**Intensity**' (_1_) of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

Effect '**Complexity**' (_2_), the higher the value, the higher the granularity. 

With '**Density**' (_3_) you can increase the density of the effect pattern. If you want to adjust it on each axis, use '**Cells**' (_4_).

With '**Speed**' (_5_) you can change the rate of change between patterns.

With '**Tilt**' (_6_) you can adjust the angle of the effect. You can also adjust the threshold used to apply or not the effect with '**Threshold**' (_7_).

Use '**Blend**' (_8_) to change the color blending function of the effect with the original image.

Finally with '**Broken tint**' (_9_) you can adjust the color of the broken screen effect and with '**Background tint**' (_10_) you can adjust the color of the unbroken areas.

#
---

## Misc

All effects have a panel, '**Color**', in which you can modify the final color of the effect.

{{< image src="color.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

They also have an '**Advanced**' panel with these options:

{{< image src="advanced.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

Activate '**Affect the Scene View?**' (_1_) if you want the effect to be applied also in the '_Scene_' window of the Editor. With '**Filter mode**' (_2_) you can change the type of filter used.

Although it is not recommended to change it, with '**RenderPass event**' (_3_) you can modify at which point in the render pipeline the effect is applied. Finally, activate '**Enable profiling**' (_4_) to show in the '_Profiling_' window the metrics of the effect.

---
## F.A.Q.

##### _How to make the effect also affect the UI?_

In order for the UI not to be affected by the effect, you should set the 'Render Mode' of your canvas from 'Screen Space - Overlay' to 'Screen Space - Camera' and dragging your camera with to 'Render Camera'.

{{< image src="ui.jpg" wrapper="col-6 mx-auto">}}

Note that when you make this change, the coordinates of your UI will be in camera space, so you will have to change them.
<br>

##### _When Bloom is added, its intensity is too low or the effect stops working._

Bloom's URP Unity effect is not compatible with postprocessing effects based on [ScriptableRendererFeature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/renderer-features/scriptable-renderer-features/inject-a-pass-using-a-scriptable-renderer-feature.html?q=ScriptableRendererFeature) (like this one).

You will have to add your own one based on ScriptableRendererFeature or you can use [this one at no cost](https://github.com/FronkonGames/ScriptableRenderBloom) ;)
<br>

##### _Can I use it in a material?_

Yes! Any effect can easily be used on a material. Just follow these steps:

* In the '**Project**' window, open the '**Create**' menu with the right mouse button and select '**Create > Render Texture**'.
* Create a new camera and in '**Output Texture**' select the Render Texture previously created. Remember to activate '**Post Processing**' and select in '**Renderer**' where you have the effect added.
* In the material you want to use, select in '**Base Map**' the Render Texture.
