{{< alert color="light" >}}
You can obtain each effect separately, but if you want multiple effects, you might be interested in **'[GLITCHES BUNDLE](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-bundle-295977?aid=1101l9zFC&utm_source=aff)'** where you can find them all at a special price!
{{< /alert >}}

## Requirements

All '**Glitches**' effects are developed for '[Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html)' (or URP), which means they will **not work** with Built-In, or HDRP.

#### Unity 6 or Higher

All effects are compatible with **Unity 6**, and use the new [Render Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/render-graph-introduction.html). You will need to have URP version *17.0.2* or higher installed. In the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/InstallURPIntoAProject.html) you can find the steps to install it correctly.

Make sure that the '_Compatibility Mode_' is **disabled** (_Project Settings > Graphics > Render Graph_).

{{< image src="compatibility_mode.jpg" wrapper="col-6 mx-auto">}}

## Installation

#### Step 1: Add Renderer Feature

The effects must be registered in your project's [URP configuration](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/urp/introduction-landing.html):

1. Locate your **Universal Renderer Data** asset.
2. Click **Add Renderer Feature** and select the desired distortion from **Fronkon Games > Glitches**.

Once installed, you have to add the effect you want to use from '**Glitches**' as a '[Render Feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature.html)'. This [official tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature-how-to-add.html) tells how to do it.

Remember that the camera you are using must have the '**Post Processing**' option enabled.

{{< image src="editor_camera.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

{{< alert color="info" >}}
'_Quality_' levels (_Project Settings > Quality_) can have their own active '_Render Pipeline Asset_'.

If so, whatever you assign in '_Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings_' in '_Graphics_' will be ignored.

**Remember to add the effect to the quality levels you want to use.**
{{< /alert >}}

#### Step 2: Configure The Volume

To apply the effects to your scene:

1. Create a **Volume** component (Global or Local) or select one that has already been created.
2. In the Volume component, create or assign a **Volume Profile**.
3. Click **Add Override** and select the desired distortion from **Fronkon Games > Glitches**.
4. Enable the '**Intensity**' parameter (and any others you wish to modify).

{{< alert color="info" >}}
Remember that for a parameter to take effect, you must activate it. Click on '**ALL**' to activate them all.
{{< /alert >}}

#### VR

To increase compatibility with VR devices, I recommend that you select '**Stereo Rendering Mode**' in '**Multi Pass**' mode:

{{< image src="vr.jpg" wrapper="col-8 mx-auto">}}

#### Code

Once you have added the effect in the Editor, the effects can be modified at runtime using the standard [Unity Volume API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.0/manual/Volumes.html).

First you must add the corresponding namespace. They are all of the style 'FronkonGames.Glitches.XXXX', where XXXX is the name of the effect. For example, if the effect you want to use is '**Artifacts**' the code would be:

```csharp
using FronkonGames.Glitches.Artifacts;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;

// ...

[SerializeField]
private VolumeProfile volumeProfile;

// ...

if (volumeProfile.TryGet(out ArtifactsVolume volume))
{
  volume.intensity.value = 0.5f;
  volume.lines.value = -0.2f;
}
```

And how can I activate and deactivate the effect? It's as easy as that:

```csharp
// Switch between active and inactive.
if (volume.active == true)
  volume.active = false;
else
  volume.active = true;
```

If you are using an effect other than '**Artifacts**' just change it to its name. Check the source code comments for more information.

## 💾 Corrupt Memory {#corruptmemory}
{{< asset-header youtube="F4ubH6fGgcA" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-corrupt-memory-274730" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/corruptmemory/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Corrupt Memory** replicates the visual noise and distortion patterns often seen in corrupted video memory or during a cyberattack.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="corrupt_memory_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters modify the underlying pattern of overlapping rectangles. The first thing you can adjust is the '**Complexity**' of the pattern and the '**Density**' of the rectangles.
Then the '**Speed**' with which they vary and their '**Scrolling**' on the screen. Finally, you can also change their '**Zoom**'.

If you want to see the pattern more clearly while adjusting these, activate '**Debug view**'.

#### Effect Zones
The pattern is used to define the zones where three effects will be applied: **pixelation**, **chromatic aberration**, and **image displacement**.

In all of them you can adjust the intensity of the effect and the limit at which it is activated ('**Threshold**'). With a very high threshold, it will use very few rectangles of the pattern. With a very low threshold, many.


---
## 📡 Interferences {#interferences}
{{< asset-header youtube="lYrj9jj3U8Y" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-interferences-281861" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/interferences/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Interferences** replicates the visual artifacts of signal degradation, electronic interference, and horizontal scanline noise. Ideal for "lo-fi" aesthetics, malfunctioning monitors, or digital transmission errors.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="interferences_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters control the core signal degradation logic. Use '**Blend**' to define the mathematical operation used to mix interference layers, and adjust '**Offset**' to create chromatic aberration by displacing the color channels in the affected zones.

The horizontal image "tearing" is controlled through several distortion parameters: '**Distortion**' sets the maximum displacement, while '**Distortion Speed**' and '**Distortion Density**' define the evolution and vertical scale of the patterns.

You can further refine these with '**Distortion Amplitude**' and '**Distortion Frequency**' for more complex wave-like behaviors.

Finally, the horizontal scanline overlay can be customized using '**Scanlines**' visibility, '**Scanlines Density**' for spacing, and '**Scanlines Opacity**' for the darkening strength.

---
## 📼 VHS {#vhs}
{{< asset-header youtube="f3W4_dPwZK0" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-vhs-282181" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/vhs/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**VHS** is a post-processing effect designed to recreate the distinct look and artifacts of analog video tapes. It captures the essence of 80s and 90s home video, featuring magnetic tape noise, tracking errors, and color instability.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="vhs_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters replicate the artifacts of magnetic tape playback. You can control the appearance of static with '**Noise**', its '**Noise Speed**', and '**Noise Size**'.

The color of this noise can be customized with '**Noise Color**' and its integration via '**Noise Blend**'.

Playback tracking errors, such as those seen during a pause, are simulated using the '**Pause**' parameter.

You can adjust the intensity of the interference band with '**Pause Band**', the amount of jitter with '**Pause Noise**', and the color/integration with '**Pause Color**' and '**Pause Blend**'.

---
## 🌀 Distortions {#distortions}
{{< asset-header youtube="ydWFcmFnSaU" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-distortions-282947" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/distortions/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

### 🔍 Magnifying {#magnifying}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/magnifying.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Simulates a magnifying lens.

{{< image src="magnifying.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Adjust the '**Center**', '**Magnification**' (zoom level), and '**Radius**' of the lens.

{{< alert color="info" icon="fas triangle-exclamation" >}}
High values of '**Magnification**' can show very pixelated images.
{{< /alert >}}

You can customize the look with '**Tint**' and '**Border**' settings.

It also includes '**Distortion**' and '**Distortion Power**' to simulate chromatic aberration at the lens edges.

### 🌪️ Swirl {#swirl}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/swirl.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Twists the screen around a point.

{{< image src="swirl.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Adjust the '**Angle**' of torsion [-1080.0, 1080.0], the reach with '**Radius**', and the anchor point with '**Center**'.

'**Threshold**' controls the smoothness of the effect transition at the edges.

### 🫨 Tremors {#tremors}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/tremors.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Screen shake and blur effect.

{{< image src="tremors.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Increase '**Samples**' for higher blur quality [1 - 5].

You can control '**Strength**' and '**Speed**' independently for each axis, and adjust the wave '**Amplitude**' and '**Frequency**' for complex vibrations.

### 🎯 Scope {#scope}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/scope.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Sniper scope or barrel distortion.

{{< image src="scope.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Features '**Center**' and '**Radius**' for aiming, a '**Vignette**' for edge darkening, and '**Radial Distortion**' based on a lens [formula](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#:%7E:text=The%20next%20figures,monotonically%20increasing) (K1, K2, K3).

'**Dispersion**' adds chromatic aberration at the edges of the sight.

### 🎈 Inflate {#inflate}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/inflate.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Swell or deflate specific areas.

{{< image src="inflate.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Use a positive '**Strength**' to inflate and negative to deflate [-1.0, 1.0].

The '**Radius**' and '**Center**' define the focus and reach of the deformation.

### 🐟 Fisheye {#fisheye}

{{< video src="/store/glitches/distortions/fisheye.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true">}}

Classic lens distortion.

{{< image src="fisheye.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

Use '**Strength**' to adjust the intensity: values above 0 for a fisheye effect, and below 0 for anti-fisheye [-0.5, 0.5].

You can also set the '**Center**' of the distortion, and use '**Blend**' and '**Tint**' to modify the final color.

## 📷 Cheap Camera {#cheap-camera}

{{< asset-header youtube="GJZYzdBmruM" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-cheap-camera-287563" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/cheap-camera/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Cheap Camera** replicates the visual characteristics of low-quality cameras, including lens distortion, sensor noise, and poor color reproduction.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="cheap_camera_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters simulate the imperfections of cheap optics. You can adjust the '**Vignette**' to darken or brighten the corners, and use '**Chromatic Aberration**' to add color fringing at the edges.

The physical deformation of the image is controlled through '**Radial Distortion**' (curvature) and '**Tangential Distortion**' (misalignment), while '**Zoom**' allows for field of view adjustments.

#### Sensor Settings
These settings replicate the limitations of low-end image sensors. Use '**Resolution**' to simulate low pixel counts, and adjust '**Blur Quality**' for the desired aesthetic.

You can add static or dynamic grain with '**Pixel Noise**', and control the signal strength before and after noise application using '**Exposure**' and '**Gain**'.

Finally, '**Dynamic Range**' modulates the sensor's bit depth for color reproduction.

#### Processor Settings

Simulates internal camera image processing. This section includes '**Functions**' for edge detection, sharpening, and pixel size adjustments.

You can also fine-tune the '**White Balance**' to shift the overall color temperature of the captured frame.

## 🔥 Bap GPU {#bad-gpu}
{{< asset-header youtube="Q86NARQPUJk" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-bad-gpu-288689" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/bad-gpu/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

Simulates the visual artifacts characteristic of failing graphics hardware, including pixel scrambling, memory corruption patterns, and signal degradation. Unlike other glitch effects that simulate external interference, this effect emulates internal GPU malfunction through sophisticated coordinate manipulation and noise generation algorithms.

The core innovation lies in the use of **Morton/Z-order** curves for pixel coordinate transformation. This space-filling curve algorithm interleaves bits from X and Y coordinates to create a linear index that preserves spatial locality. When noise is applied to this Morton-encoded index and then converted back to UV coordinates, the result creates the characteristic blocky, hardware-corruption appearance rather than smooth gradient distortions.

{{< alert type="info" >}}
The Morton curve implementation uses O(1) bit manipulation tricks, enabling real-time pixel scrambling without expensive texture lookups or compute shaders.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Requisites

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, your project must meet the following requirements:

*   **Unity:** 6000.0.58f1 or higher.
*   **Universal RP:** 17.0.3 or higher.

#### Instalation Guide

##### Step 1: Add Renderer Feature

The effect must be registered in your project's URP configuration:

1. Locate your **Universal Renderer Data** asset.
2. Click **Add Renderer Feature** and select **Fronkon Games > Glitches > Bad GPU**.

##### Step 2: Configure the Volume

To apply the effect to your scene:

1. Create a **Volume** component (Global or Local).
2. In the Volume component, create or assign a **Volume Profile**.
3. Click **Add Override** and select **Fronkon Games > Glitches > Bad GPU**.
4. Enable the '**Intensity**' parameter (and any others you wish to modify).


#### Parameter Configuration

{{< image src="badgpu_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

##### Signal Parameters

The core parameters control the balance between the original image and the corrupted output.

* **Balance** [-1.0 to 1.0]: Negative values favor the original image, positive values enhance the glitch effect. At 0.0, mixing depends on pixel difference magnitude.
* **Booster** [0.0 to 10.0]: Multiplies the glitch color intensity before blending. Higher values create more severe corruption.
* **Blend**: Selects from 23 color blend modes (Solid, Screen, Difference, etc.).
* **Tint**: Applies a color filter to the glitch artifacts before blending.

##### Four-Layer Glitch System

The effect implements four independent noise layers (Glitch 1-4), each contributing distinct artifact patterns. This multi-layered approach simulates the complex cascading failures that occur in actual GPU hardware problems.

{{< table >}}
| **Layer** | **Noise Scale** | **Characteristic** | **Typical Use Case** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glitch 1 | 1×10⁻³ | Blocky posterized artifacts with 4 levels | Main chunk corruption |
| Glitch 2 | 1×10⁻⁵ | Fine-grained noise with 20 posterization levels | Bit-level errors |
| Glitch 3 | 1×10³ | Large-scale displacement with threshold control | Memory addressing failures |
| Glitch 4 | 0.01 | Subtle random color injection | Signal degradation |
{{< /table >}}

Each layer combines three operations: noise generation scaled by coordinate position, posterization for quantization, and threshold application for selective activation. The noise function uses 1D value noise with linear interpolation, scaled by time-dependent speed parameters.

##### Color Grading

Standard color correction parameters apply to the final output.

{{< table >}}
| **Parameter** | **Range** | **Effect** | **Default** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brightness | -1.0 to 1.0 | Additive luminance offset | 0.0 |
| Contrast | 0.0 to 10.0 | Mid-tone contrast expansion | 1.0 |
| Gamma | 0.1 to 10.0 | Nonlinear tonal mapping (inverted) | 1.0 |
| Hue | 0.0 to 1.0 | Color wheel rotation | 0.0 |
| Saturation | 0.0 to 2.0 | Color intensity relative to luminance | 1.0
{{< /table >}}

These operations follow standard image processing order: contrast expansion → hue rotation → gamma correction → saturation adjustment.

#### Runtime Control

The effect integrates with Unity's Volume system for seamless runtime parameter modification. Access the **BadGPUVolume** component through the Volume Profile.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;
using FronkonGames.Glitches.BadGPU;

// ...

[SerializedField]
private VolumeProfile volumeProfile;

// ...

// Access the effect
if (volumeProfile.TryGet(out BadGPUVolume volume))
{
    // Enable/disable effect
    volume.intensity.value = 1.0f; // 0.0 = disabled
    
    // Configure signal parameters
    volume.balance.value = 0.3f;
    volume.booster.value = 2.5f;
    volume.blend.value = ColorBlends.Difference;
    volume.tint.value = new Color(1.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f);
    
    // Control individual glitch layers
    volume.glitch1.value = 0.2f;
    volume.glitch1Speed.value = 0.5f;
    volume.glitch1Threshold.value = 0.6f;
    
    // Apply color correction
    volume.contrast.value = 1.2f;
    volume.saturation.value = 0.8f;
}
```

For a more detailed example, check the code in the demo scene.

##### Performance Characteristics

The effect executes in a single render pass with **O(1)** per-pixel complexity. The Morton curve operations use bitwise manipulation without branching, and noise generation employs analytical functions rather than texture lookups.

Performance considerations:

* Pass Count: 1 blit pass.
* Texture Samples: 2 per pixel (original and displaced coordinate).
* Branching: Minimal (threshold comparisons use step() intrinsic).
* Memory: No additional textures or compute buffers.

#### Preset Configurations

##### Subtle Artifacts

Suitable for environmental storytelling or failing electronics.

```
Intensity: 0.15, Balance: -0.3, Booster: 0.8, Blend: Solid
Glitch 1: Intensity 0.05, Speed 0.2, Threshold 0.8
Glitch 2: Intensity 0.03, Speed 2.0, Threshold 0.95
```

##### Critical Failure

Creates severe corruption for intense scenes or catastrophic events.

```
Intensity: 0.8, Balance: 0.4, Booster: 5.0, Blend: Difference, Tint: Orange
Glitch 1: Intensity 0.3, Speed 1.0, Threshold 0.6
Glitch 2: Intensity 0.2, Speed 4.0, Threshold 0.8
Glitch 3: Intensity 0.2, Speed 0.5, Threshold 0.5
Glitch 4: Intensity 0.15, Speed 0.1, Threshold 0.9
```

## 📦 Artifacts {#artifacts}
{{< asset-header youtube="tyg11e6XrQQ" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-artifacts-288952" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/artifacts/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Artifacts** replicates the visual noise and blocking patterns often seen in low-bitrate digital video, poor signal reception, or highly compressed media.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="artifacts_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters control the generation of digital artifacts. The '**Size**' defines the dimensions of the blocks in pixels, while '**Luminance Range**' can be used to restrict the effect to specific brightness levels.

You can adjust the probability and intensity of macro-block artifacts with '**Blocks**', and customize their look using '**Block Blend**' and '**Block Tint**'.

Similarly, '**Lines**' controls horizontal line artifacts with its own '**Line Blend**' and '**Line Tint**' settings. Finally, '**Aberration**' adds color channel misalignment, and '**Interleave**' applies an RGB sub-pixel pattern.

## 💀 Hacked {#hacked}
{{< asset-header youtube="gjgyrVs8yx0" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-hacked-293724" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/hacked/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Hacked** is a high-performance post-processing effect that simulates a variety of digital glitches, frame jumps, and compression artifacts, giving the impression of a hacked or malfunctioning system.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="hacked_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

The hacking effect is achieved by combining six different effects. '**Strength**' modulates the intensity of **all** these effects.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_framejump.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Frame jump" >}}

The first effect is '**Frame jump**', commonly caused by a synchronization failure between the signal and the monitor. In addition to its intensity, you can adjust its speed.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_jitter.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Jitter" >}}

'**Jitter**' creates horizontal bands that _slice_ the image. In addition to their intensity and speed, you can modify their density.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_blocks.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Blocks" >}}

'**Blocks**' creates a multitude of blocks that deform the color channels. You can adjust their density, chromatic aberration intensity and noise.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_waves.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Waves" >}}

With '**Waves**' you can add a sine wave deformation that alters the color channels, and you can adjust its speed and the intensity of the color channel separation.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_scanlines.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Scanlines" >}}

'**Scanlines**' adds a horizontal noise.

{{< video src="/store/glitches/hacked/hacked_noise.mp4" loop="true" autoplay="true" title="Noise" >}}

Finally '**Noise**' creates the classic analog noise.

## 🔨 Broken LCD {#broken-lcd}
{{< asset-header youtube="BgRcZrxu280" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-broken-lcd-294991" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/broken-lcd/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Broken LCD** simulates the visual artifacts of a damaged liquid crystal display, including dead pixels, color bleeding, and screen fractures.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="brokenlcd_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

These parameters control the generation of the LCD damage artifacts. The '**Complexity**' defines the granularity of the effect [1 - 10], while '**Density**' and '**Cells**' control the concentration and number of block patterns.

You can adjust the frame rate of change with '**Speed**', and use '**Offset**' and '**Tilt**' to scroll or incline the visual interference.

The '**Threshold**' acts as an activation limit for the effect on the screen.

Finally, you can customize the appearance using '**Blend**' modes, and apply independent color tints to the '**Broken**' (damaged) areas and the '**Background**' (undamaged) zones.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Color Blindness {#colorblindness}
{{< asset-header youtube="f5CiPt9bzBE" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-color-blindness-273126" demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/colorblindness/" warn="assets used in video and demo are not included">}}

**Color Blindness** accurately replicates how people with different types of color vision deficiency perceive the world, making it an essential tool for accessibility testing and artistic expression.

This asset **simulates** a series of vision defects, **NOT** corrects them.

Once installed, when you select your '_Volume_', you will see something like this:

{{< image src="color_blindness_0.jpg" wrapper="col-10 mx-auto">}}

With '**Intensity**' you can control the overall strength of the effect [0.0 - 1.0]. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

The core of the simulation is the '**Deficiency**' parameter, which allows you to select from a wide range of color vision conditions, including red-green (Protanopia, Deuteranopia), blue-yellow (Tritanopia), and total color blindness (Achromatopsia), as well as their anomalous trichromacy variants.

* **Protanomaly**: red-green vision deficiency, 1% of males, 0.03% of females.
* **Deuteranomaly**: red-green color blindness, 6% of males, 0.4% of females.
* **Tritanomaly**: blue-yellow color blindness, 0.01% for males and females.
* **Protanopia**: reds are greatly reduced, 1% of males, 0.02% of females.
* **Deuteranopia**: greens are greatly reduced, 1% of males.
* **Tritanopia**: blues are greatly reduced, 0.003% population.
* **Achromatopsia**: total color blindness, 0.001% population.
* **Achromatomaly**: partial color blindness, 0.00001% population.

To facilitate testing and visualization, you can use the '**Comparator**' to split the screen, allowing a direct side-by-side comparison between normal vision and the selected deficiency.

You can further customize this view by adjusting the '**Comparator Size**' and the '**Comparator Color**' of the dividing bar.

## Misc

All effects have a image grading tools, '**Color**', for aesthetic fine-tuning: **Brightness**, **Contrast**, **Gamma**, **Hue**, and **Saturation**.

They also have an '**Advanced**' panel with these options:

Activate '**Affect the Scene View**' if you want the effect to be applied also in the '_Scene_' window of the Editor.

## F.A.Q.

##### _How to make the effect also affect the UI?_

In order for the UI not to be affected by the effect, you should set the 'Render Mode' of your canvas from 'Screen Space - Overlay' to 'Screen Space - Camera' and dragging your camera with to 'Render Camera'.

{{< image src="ui.jpg" wrapper="col-6 mx-auto">}}

Note that when you make this change, the coordinates of your UI will be in camera space, so you will have to change them.

##### _When Bloom is added, its intensity is too low or the effect stops working._

Bloom's URP Unity effect is not compatible with postprocessing effects based on [ScriptableRendererFeature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/renderer-features/scriptable-renderer-features/inject-a-pass-using-a-scriptable-renderer-feature.html?q=ScriptableRendererFeature) (like this one).

You will have to add your own one based on ScriptableRendererFeature or you can use [this one at no cost](https://github.com/FronkonGames/ScriptableRenderBloom) ;)
<br>

##### _Can I use it in a material?_

Yes! Any effect can easily be used on a material. Just follow these steps:

* In the '**Project**' window, open the '**Create**' menu with the right mouse button and select '**Create > Render Texture**'.
* Create a new camera and in '**Output Texture**' select the Render Texture previously created. Remember to activate '**Post Processing**' and select in '**Renderer**' where you have the effect added.
* In the material you want to use, select in '**Base Map**' the Render Texture.
