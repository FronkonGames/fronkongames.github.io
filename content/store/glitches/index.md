'**Glitches**' contains the following assets:

* [Color Blindness](#colorblindness), simulates the most common vision defects.
* [Corrupt Memory](#corruptmemory), a cyber attack? no, it's just corrupted memory.
* [Interferences](#interferences), something is interfering with the signal...
* [VHS](#vhs), the beauty of analog.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

All '**Glitches**' effects are developed for '[Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/index.html)' (or URP)', which means they will **not work** with Built-In, or HDRP.

You will need to have URP version 12.1 or higher installed. If you don't know how to do it, I recommend you to follow this [official tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html).

## üñ•Ô∏è Using them in the Editor

Once installed, you have to add the effect you want to use from '**Glitches**' as a '[Render Feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature.html)'. This [official tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@12.1/manual/urp-renderer-feature-how-to-add.html) tells how to do it.

Remember that the camera you are using must have the '**Post Processing**' option enabled.

## ü•∏ VR

To increase compatibility with VR devices, I recommend that you select '**Stereo Rendering Mode**' in '**Multi Pass**' mode:

{{< rawhtml >}}<br><br>{{< /rawhtml >}}
## ü™Ñ Using them in code

You can also handle '**Glitches**' effects by code. The first thing you will have to do is to add the namespace of the effect you want to use.

They are all of the style 'FronkonGames.Glitches.XXXX', where XXXX is the name of the effect. For example, if the effect you want to use is '**Color Blindness**' the code would be:

{{< highlight csharp "linenos=false" >}}
using FronkonGames.Glitches.ColorBlindness;
{{< /highlight >}}
</br>

And with this code you could check if the effect is added, and if it is not, add it.

{{< highlight csharp "linenos=false" >}}
if (ColorBlindness.IsInRenderFeatures() == false)
    ColorBlindness.AddRenderFeature();
{{< /highlight >}}
</br>

To modify any of the effect parameters, you must first request its __settings__. In the following example we change the intensity of the effect by half.

{{< highlight csharp "linenos=false" >}}
 ColorBlindness.Settings settings = ColorBlindness.GetSettings();

 settings.intensity = 0.5f;
 {{< /highlight >}}
</br>

If you are using an effect other than '**Color Blindness**' just change it to its name. Check the source code comments for more information.

{{< asset-buttons demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/colorblindness/" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-color-blindness-273126">}}

'**Color Blindness**' simulates the most common vision defects.

{{< notice warning "" >}}
This asset **simulates** a series of vision defects, **NOT** corrects them.
{{< /notice >}}

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/colorblindness_0.jpg" >}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

Select the type of deficiency you want to simulate with '**Deficiency**' (_2_):

* **Protanomaly**: red-green vision deficiency, 1% of males, 0.03% of females.
* **Deuteranomaly**: red-green color blindness, 6% of males, 0.4% of females.
* **Tritanomaly**: blue-yellow color blindness, 0.01% for males and females.
* **Protanopia**: reds are greatly reduced, 1% of males, 0.02% of females.
* **Deuteranopia**: greens are greatly reduced, 1% of males.
* **Tritanopia**: blues are greatly reduced, 0.003% population.
* **Achromatopsia**: total color blindness, 0.001% population.
* **Achromatomaly**: partial color blindness, 0.00001% population.

In order to compare the result with a normal view, move '**Comparator**'.

Finally, if you click on '**documentation**' (_4_) you will go to the online documentation. If you need support, you can send me an email to '_frokongames@gmail.com_' or you can click on '**support**' (_5_). If you need to reset all the effect values, click on '**Reset**' (_6_).

# {#corruptmemory}

{{< asset-buttons demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/corruptmemory/" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-corrupt-memory-274730" >}}

'**Corrupt Memory**' emulates malfunctioning memory.
'**Corrupt Memory**' emulates malfunctioning memory.

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/corruptmemory_0.jpg">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

The effect generates a pattern of overlapping rectangles that change dimensions and position randomly. The first parameters (from _2_ to _6_), modify this pattern. If you want to see it better, activate '**Debug view**' (_10_).

The first thing you can adjust is the complexity (_2_) of the pattern and the density (_3_) of the rectangles. Then the speed (_4_) with which they vary and their displacement (_5_) on the screen. Finally you can also change their magnification (_6_).

The pattern is used to define the zones where three effects will be applied. The first one is a pixelation effect (_7_), then a chromatic aberration effect (_8_) and finally an image displacement effect (_9_).

In all of them you can adjust the limit at which it is activated ('_Threshold_'). With a very high limit, it will use very few rectangles of the pattern. With a very low limit, many.

Finally, if you click on '**documentation**' (_4_) you will go to the online documentation. If you need support, you can send me an email to '_frokongames@gmail.com_' or you can click on '**support**' (_5_). If you need to reset all the effect values, click on '**Reset**' (_6_).

# {#interferences}
{{< youtube lYrj9jj3U8Y >}}

{{< asset-buttons demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/interferences/" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-interferences-281861" >}}

With '**Interferences**' you can simulate video transmission failures.

Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/interferences_0.jpg">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

With '**Blend**' (_2_) modify the color operation used to blend the original pixel with the effect pixel.

'**Offset**' (_3_) amplifies the strength of the effect.

From the distortion effect (_4_) you can control different variables such as speed, density, amplitude and frequency.

The second effect applied is scanlines (_5_) and you can adjust its density and opacity.

Finally, if you click on '**documentation**' (_6_) you will go to the online documentation. If you need support, you can send me an email to '_frokongames@gmail.com_' or you can click on '**support**' (_7_). If you need to reset all the effect values, click on '**Reset**' (_8_).

{{< asset-buttons demo="https://fronkongames.github.io/demos-glitches/vhs/" store="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/glitches-vhs-282181">}}

Accurately emulates an old VHS tape. Once installed, when you select your '_Universal Renderer Data_', you will see something like this:

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/vhs_0.jpg">}}

With '**Intensity**' (_1_) you can control the intensity of the effect. If it is 0, the effect will not be active.

**VHS**' consists of two very typical effects of the old VHS tapes: the noise and the pause.

The first one can be controlled using '**Noise**' (_2_) and its parameters. The second with '**Pause**' (_3_) and '**Pause Band**' (_4_).

If you want to use only the noise, set '**Pause**' (_3_) and '**Pause Band**' (_4_) to zero. If you only want to use the pause effect, set '**Noise**' (_2_) to zero.

Finally, if you click on '**documentation**' (_4_) you will go to the online documentation. If you need support, you can send me an email to '_frokongames@gmail.com_' or you can click on '**support**' (_6_). If you need to reset all the effect values, click on '**Reset**' (_7_).

## üìä Misc

All '**Glitches**' effects have a panel, '**Color**', in which you can modify the final color of the effect.

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/color.jpg" >}}

They also have an '**Advanced**' panel with these options:

{{< imagecenter src="/store/glitches/advanced.jpg" >}}

Activate '**Affect the Scene View?**' (_1_) if you want the effect to be applied also in the '_Scene_' window of the Editor. With '**Filter mode**' (_2_) you can change the type of filter used.

Although it is not recommended to change it, with '**RenderPass event**' (_3_) you can modify at which point in the render pipeline the effect is applied. Finally, activate '**Enable profiling**' (_4_) to show in the '_Profiling_' window the metrics of the effect.
