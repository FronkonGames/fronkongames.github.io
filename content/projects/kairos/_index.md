**Kairos** is a personal devblog documenting the journey of creating an indie card game set in a zombie apocalypse. Developed using **Unity** and the custom-built **[Game:Work](https://github.com/FronkonGames)** framework (MIT), this project explores the intersection of strategy, atmosphere, and technical experimentation.

Follow along as I share progress on everything from 3D card rendering and physics-based interactions to game design decisions and the challenges of solo development.
